                        Today you will discover which strategy, in particular which choices of European Union's countries, have influenced in positive the fight against the Covid-19.<br>

                        <br> Here are the websites from where we took our data: <br>
                        <a class="link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#explore-the-global-situation" target="_blank"> Our World In Data: Coronavirus</a> <br>

                    <p class="lead mb-0">Our goal is to find out through data what factors have influenced most against the Covid-19
                        crisis and to have a better strategy against this pandemic crisis.
                        We decided to compare European countries to get an answer to our problem.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">We structured our presentation in three parts:<br>
                        <b>1) DISCOVER:</b> Which between the European Union's countries are the best top five against Covid-19?<br>
                        <b>2) ANALYSIS:</b> Which factors are used by the top 5 countries?<br>
                        <b>3) CONCLUSION:</b> Which countries used these factors in the European Union?

                    <h5 style="text-align:center !important;">Which between the European Union's countries are the best top five against Covid-19?</h5>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">In this part, our goal it's to select only the best 5 countries (for each wave) between all the 27 countries of the European Union.<br><br>
                        There are two main reasons: <br>
                        <b>1) The first reason</b> is to make the analysis clearer because too many data will give issues to read them in the proper way.
                        <u> In this part we did an exception even if it's a bit messy because we can't exclude countries without a valid reason.</u> <br>
                        <b>2) The second reason</b> is to demonstrate after this part which from this top 5 countries have used the best factors to fight against
                        the pandemic crisis<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">To obtain which countries were the best, we constructed 3 different graphs based to death numbers in the European Union's countries: <br>
                        <b>A) LINE CHART:</b> New deaths per day due to Covid-19<br>
                        <b>B) LINE CHART:</b> New deaths based to the density of population per day due to Covid-19<br>
                        <b>C) LINE CHART:</b> New deaths per million per day due to Covid-19 per day due to Covid-19<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">Furthermore, we decided to divide the data in 3 different waves, because the strategy during time could have changed and so the
                        factors could be different in front of each situation.<br>
                        To distribute the waves, we looked where in time the Covid-19's new deaths were reduced, so we obtained this distribution:<br>
                        1st wave: from 15/02/2020 to 20/07/2020; <br> 2nd wave: from 20/07/2020 to 10/07/2021; <br>3th wave: from 10/07/2021 to 16/02/2023.<br><br>

                <div class="col-lg-11">
                    <h5 style="text-align:center !important;">Aspects to consider</h5>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">We will consider these aspects to have a valid decision on which countries to consider best.<br><br>

                        1) WHEN COVID ARRIVED: <br>
                        An important aspect to consider that has impacted a lot against the country<br>
                        <b>JANUARY:</b>
                        France; Germany; Finland; Italy; Spain; Sweden;<br>
                        <b>FEBRUARY: </b>
                        Belgium; Austria; Croatia; Greece; Romania; Denmark; Estonia; Netherlands; Lithuania; Ireland; Luxembourg;
                        <br>
                        <b>MARCH:</b>
                        Czechia; Latvia; Portugal; Hungary; Poland; Slovenia; Slovakia; Malta; Bulgaria; Cyprus; <br>
                        <br>
                        2) ISLANDS AND LITTLE COUNTRIES:<br>
                        We think that an other important aspect is the population and the isolation of the country considered. In fact it's easier
                        to manage less population and even more if isolated. <br>
                        Here are the countries with less 3 million people we decided to exclude to our top 5 (but we insert in our graphs anyway):
                        Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia ,Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta<br><br>

                        3) DENSITY OF POPULATION:<br>
                        The density tells a lot in the crisis due to a higher proximity of people. So we considered the countries with less density but higher death per
                        density to be worse.
                        <br> <br>
                        4) THE POPULATION:<br>
                        Having more deaths per million means having managed worse the pandemic crisis.<br><br>
